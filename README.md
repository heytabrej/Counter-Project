# Counter Project

This project consists of a basic web page with a counter implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can do this by double-clicking on the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" your preferred browser.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the elements on the page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the counter functionality.

## Features

- **Counter Label**: Displays the current count in a large font at the center of the page.
- **Buttons**:
  - **Decrease**: Click to decrease the counter value.
  - **Reset**: Click to reset the counter value to zero.
  - **Increase**: Click to increase the counter value.

## Styling

- The background color of the page is set to a light green shade (`rgb(181, 236, 42)`).
- The counter label and buttons are styled for a visually appealing look.

## How it Works

- The counter value is initially set to 0 and displayed on the page.
- Clicking the "Increase" button increments the counter.
- Clicking the "Decrease" button decrements the counter.
- Clicking the "Reset" button resets the counter to 0.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styles or expand the functionality based on your preferences. You can modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file or add more JavaScript functionality in the `script.js` file.
